## Hi there 👋

# Hey, I'm Miguel 👋

I'm a first-generation senior at the **University of Oregon** studying **Computer Science** and **Data Science**.  
I like building full-stack tools that *actually get used* — things that help students, clubs, and everyday people.

---

## 🧑‍💻 What I Do

- 💻 **Full-stack dev** – React / Next.js on the front, Python/FastAPI or Node on the back, Supabase/Postgres underneath.
- 📊 **Data science & analytics** – Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, R, Tableau, and real datasets (not just toy CSVs).
- 🧠 **Applied AI** – building small, practical AI tools (interview coach, data-driven apps, etc.) instead of just demos.

Right now, I'm especially interested in:
- Backend + databases for real products
- AI/ML in education & productivity
- Systems that turn messy data into something people can actually use

## 🚀 Projects I’m Proud Of

- 🧮 **High School Math Web App**  
  Built for my old high school where a lot of students don’t see themselves in STEM.  
  Uses **Next.js**, a custom problem engine, and **FRED** salary data to connect math concepts to real careers and income data.

- 🗓️ **Multicultural Center Event Hub**  
  Replaced a messy paper calendar with a **full-stack event platform** for student unions.  
  Students can browse events, and organizers can plan and coordinate in one place.

- 📱 **TechPrep – AI Interview Coach**  
  Mobile app (React Native + FastAPI + Supabase) that helps users practice technical interviews with:
  - Gamified quizzes
  - Long-answer questions
  - An AI “coach” that gives spoken feedback using ElevenLabs  
  👉 Built for a hackathon and won **“Best Use of Snowflake API”** for the analytics side.

- 📈 **Research & Data Projects**  
  - Cleaned and analyzed **10,000+** rows of survey & self-report data in R for a psych research project.  
  - Multiple class and personal projects using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn on real-world datasets.
